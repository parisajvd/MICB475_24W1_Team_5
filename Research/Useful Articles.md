(2018) reported that cigarette smoking increases the phylum of Bacteroidetes and decreases the phylum of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in current smokers compared with never smokers --> this is what we saw in our data as well
- https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2020.1848158: "... dietary patterns may lead to a lack of competition by other gut commensals due to which an overgrowth of Bacteroides spp. may occur. For example, an over-abundance of Bacteroides caccae results in the increased degradation of mucus, which helps reduce intestinal inflammation by decreasing bacterial interactions with intestinal epithelial cells in the intestine generally, and in the colonic mucus barrier specifically.82 Due to thinner layers of mucus, the intestinal barrier function becomes compromised, resulting in the expulsion of potential pathogens to extraintestinal locations"
