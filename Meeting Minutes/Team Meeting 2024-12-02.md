# Presentation notes
- Intro: maybe animate (transitions) the 5th page, tobacco oral, tobacco gut, e-cig oral, e-cig gut
- Maybe split 5th page into different slides
- After the general dataset: bring in different lifestyle and demographic factors (the metadata groups)
- Research Objectives: The first phase of the project was modelling (demographic factors)
- The only factor that drives significant changes to beta diversity in fecal is tobacco smoking
- Then the 2nd objective is focused on tobacco.
- for alpha diversity: say that it is not significant on the slide (put p-values as well)
- Tobacco yes/no in beta diversity
- Taxabarplot: remove the text underneath
- For deseq slide: Changes in differential abundance are associated with Tobacco
- Comparison groups for volcano plot (define yes and no)
- Node plot: no first, yes second, yes -> tobacco smoking
- Decrease in interactions between the firmicutes phyla
- Coord diagram shows similar
- Manuscript: include all 4, but for presentation only include the dot diagram only. Put more context in here because this is new. Say what the connections mean. Interactions change based on the changes in the abundance. The size of the nodes represents abundance, individual nodes show the genus. Changes in the abundance links them together
- 1 conclusion per analysis
- Maybe highlight (bold, underline) the trends you really wanna emphasize on.
- Future directions: having a larger cohort, and studying in different locations.
- For discussion: fewer firmicutes interactions and if there is anything in literature
- Supplemental figures
