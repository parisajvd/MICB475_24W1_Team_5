## Questions about manuscript
- refining title? thoughts?
- rounding p-values for the manuscript table or including the entire number?

### Reminder of the Figures/Tables:
- T1: modeling showing p-values for all the modeling separated by sample, one big table with the 3 different sample types on top of each other
- F1. 4 panels-- -- alpha diversity at top (observed A, shannon B) beta at bottom (bray-curtis C, weighted unifrac D)
- S1. 2 panels: A - jaccard, B - unweighted
- F2. phylum taxabar plot
- S2. genera taxabar plot
- F3. DESeq2- 2 panels: A = volcano plot, panel B: bar plot
- F4. functional - 4 panels (2 layers); A- dot yes, B - chord diagram yes; bottom: C- dot for no, D - chord for no.
