# Proposal Revisions
- Question about in-text citation of websites: Authors year, title , journal, volume
- Use of taxabar plots: look at the overall distribution of taxanomy? is this fair to say in our proposal?
-     Maybe deseq is better, if something is drastically different taxabar plot is useful. otherwise, it is not very useful. Combine taxa bar plot and deseq together
- Aims: comments about aims are not scientifically written.
-   For experimental aims, methods shouldn't be super emphasized.
-   Comments on writings: Hans is very specific on wordings, so evaluate the feedback and take in what seems reasonable to us.

# Modelling results and next steps
- The results of the main paper that the dataset comes from show what we found even though they didn't use a modelling system. What should our next step be?
- If the methodology is different, it is ok that we reproduced the results. We can still frame this as novel
- We should still do the taxonomic analysis (deseq), but also do a functional analysis (picrust). This can add a different layer of novelty to our dataset.
-  Question about Median Phred Score that was chosen -> we actually chose above 30! change it. our trimming parameter is ok.
