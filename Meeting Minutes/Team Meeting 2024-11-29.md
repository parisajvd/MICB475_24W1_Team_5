# Team Meeting- November 29, 2024
## Questions: 
### About the manuscript/presentation:
- how to approach the introduction and background: do we focus mainly on tobacco and fecal data studies? present a little bit of all 3 sample types (since we did modeling)?
  - also how to approach background info about the lifestyle and demographic factors since we did modeling? -- do we talk about all of them, or just tobacco since we did that for the taxonomic and functional analyses?
- how to frame research question and hypothesis? focused on modeling or focused on the tobacco and fecal microbiota?
