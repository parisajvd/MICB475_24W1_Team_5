# Team Meeting- November 29, 2024
## Feedback
- for modeling part - include a flowchart, but about what we did or how it works
  - include table of p values as Table 1 in manuscript
  - make one table big table, paste on top of each other, don't include the one with all the samples together
    - only the one separated by sample type
    - can mention in the methods that we did it all together and found nothing significant
- flowcharts for methods, metadata-based filtering  
- alpha and beta diversity
  - comparing 3 groups = significance with Bray-curtis and weighted-unifrac
  - both ones that consider abundance have lower p-values than ones that do not
  - figure 1: 4 panels -- alpha diversity at top (observed 1, shannon 2, bray-curtis 3, weighted unifrac 4)
    - also mention in methods we ran jaccard and unweighted (which was not significant but that is important)
    - S1: 2 panels: A - jaccard, B - unweighted
    - can mention trend towards decreased diversity in shannons which considers abundance
    - what's driving diversity decreased: is changes in abundance (alpha also shows)
- taxabar plots
  - increase in Prevotella and decrease in Bacteriodes in Tobacco smoking
  - the refined genera one shows patterns already
    - because we removed the rare ones it is not ideal for a main figure
  - the phylums increased correspond to the increase in genera that we found
    - literature found always increase in this genus in tobacco smoking
  - figure 2: phylum taxabar plot
    - include others in supplemental, especially if we are mentioning genus level
    - figure S2: taxabar plot at genus level
    - change axis to "relative abundance"
- deseq
  - remove the N/A one that wasn't resolved to genus
  - make it more horizontal
  - figure 3: 2 panels: A = volcano plot, panel B: bar plot
    - hopefully align with taxabar plot
- indicator genera -- don't include as a figure because doesn't add much 
  - expected to have nothing significant because we don't think that it is driven by new taxa but moreso the already existing genera
- functional - dot matrix and core diagram -- just interested in increase or decrease in change in abundance
  - likely reducing???
  - whether it is affecting intercommunity interactions
  - put network and cord diagram into one slide to compare the two
  - 2 routes: 
    - right now: tobacco smokiing affecting relative abundance of EXISTING TAXA
    - 1. does that increase or decrease interactions? -- directly dependent on changes in abundance
        - looking at interactions based on abundance   
    - or 2. finish picrust - talk about changing abundance affecting pathways, can talk about increase/decrease in functional diversity
      - changes in the presence/absence
  - 4 panels: A- dot diagram yes B- chord diagram yes C- dot for no D - chord for no 
   
# Figures 
T1: modeling showing p-values for all the modeling separated by sample, one big table with the 3 different sample types on top of each other 
1. 4 panels-- -- alpha diversity at top (observed A, shannon B) beta at bottom (bray-curtis C, weighted unifrac D)
- S1. 2 panels: A - jaccard, B - unweighted
2. phylum taxabar plot
- S2. genera taxabar plot
3. DESeq2- 2 panels: A = volcano plot, panel B: bar plot
4. functional - 4 panels (2 layers); A- dot yes, B - chord diagram yes; bottom: C- dot for no, D - chord for no. 

## Questions: 
### About the manuscript/presentation:
- how to approach the introduction and background: do we focus mainly on tobacco and fecal data studies? present a little bit of all 3 sample types (since we did modeling)?
  - also how to approach background info about the lifestyle and demographic factors since we did modeling? -- do we talk about all of them, or just tobacco since we did that for the taxonomic and functional analyses?
    - focus on tobacco smoking -- like what the paper talks about 
    - in the beginning we need to mention e-cigarettes even though we disregarded it  
- how to frame research question and hypothesis? focused on modeling or focused on the tobacco and fecal microbiota?
  - can say we had 2 research questions: modeling and tobacco smoking  
- discussion - what we found and what that means on a biological model
  - affects fecal microbiota because of evenness
  - is this something proven in other cohorts or not?
  - talk about the e-cigarettes becuase people are interested in -- talk about what other people found, do papers show significance or not
  - go from bigger picture then narrow it down
  - then talk about specific taxa that come up consistently in taxabar plot and deseq -- does it match the literature? if not, say other people haven't found it but we did.  

# presentation
- if we need a little bit of methods, it is fine (ie. flowchart is good) but results is the focus
  - remember it is 10 minutes, 1 takeaway from the 10 minutes would be good
  - if network analysis gives us something clear, then that is enough, doesn't have to be same layout as the one for the manuscript
  - alpha beta don't need to show all 4, just pick the ones that are the most useful, ie. the table of p-values, make sure to indicate which ones are significant and driven by abundance
