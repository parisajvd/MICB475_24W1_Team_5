# Pre-Meeting Notes #

**Notes on modelling**
-   Monica finished a draft of the modelling (R script/Phyloseq and Modelling Code) and ran it --> found only the sample type was significant
-   Based on Hans's comments we may need to change our proposal to reflect this
-   Only one metadata category was a challenge because height is listed as "5ft10" and I am having trouble changing this to inches so I ignored it for the first draft of the modelling
-   For Ritu: Does the modelling look ok and could you help me figure out how to adjust the height please?
  - don't include height, in the final paper specify this

**Notes on the proposal**
-   A lot of changes suggested for the introduction
-   Also for the research question/hypothesis/title, we may need to rework this?

# Revision
- remove sample type as a 'variable of interest'
- for modeling: filter the sample type to one, ie. 'fecal', then run the modeling
- cite context of papers that have shown some differences in factors, then move into the specific ones
- introduction/background:
  - before paragraph 3 and 4 in introduction- new paragraph, generally talk about different factors, ie. reviews about smoking and microbiome in general and then move into specific ones
  - when mentioning separating vapers vs cigarette users, add another part about how these could be potential factors instead of 'we hope to see' or 'expect to see'
  - can use word 'dysbiosis'
- using diversity metrics to investigate, incorporate the actual word into the sentence for the aims 
- for now, just arbitrarily choose a taxa group to look at for taxa bar plots
- better explain using bray-curtis and permanova for the experimental aims -- better explain the modeling aim
- in the introduction, last paragraph, add a sentence about how we haven't figured out our specific variable, but we want to figure it out through modeling
  - bray-curtis and permanova
- 'because we looked at literature, if it is race or bmi, we will choose that one, if it is not then we will look into literature and choose'
   -   if there are other ones, we will look into the literature to see which one is supported
- use of taxabar plot other than to look at the overall distribution-- look into literature, Ritu will get back to us
-
