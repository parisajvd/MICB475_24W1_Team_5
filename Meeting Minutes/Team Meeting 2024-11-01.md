# Pre-Meeting Notes #

**Notes on modelling**
-   Monica finished a draft of the modelling (R script/Phyloseq and Modelling Code) and ran it --> found only the sample type was significant
-   Based on Hans's comments we may need to change our proposal to reflect this
-   Only one metadata category was a challenge because height is listed as "5ft10" and I am having trouble changing this to inches so I ignored it for the first draft of the modelling
-   For Ritu: Does the modelling look ok and could you help me figure out how to adjust the height please?

**Notes on the proposal**
-   A lot of changes suggested for the introduction
-   Also for the research question/hypothesis/title, we may need to rework this?
