## Questions for Ritu
- our dataset used primers 515F and 806R for V4 region, confirm: we can use the silva-138-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza already on the server?
 - help with the approach for the modeling (aim 1)
 - do we need to specify which type of statistical testing we will use for our diversity metrics, and if so, would it be ANOVA (alpha) and PERMANOVA (beta)?
