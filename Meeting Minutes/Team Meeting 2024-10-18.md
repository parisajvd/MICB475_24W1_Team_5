## Questions for Ritu
- our dataset used primers 515F and 806R for V4 region, confirm: we can use the silva-138-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza already on the server?
- Looking at table-no-choloroplast-no-mitochondria.qzv file vs looking at alpha-rarefication.qzv file, what is the best rarefication depth to choose?
 - help with the approach for the modeling (aim 1)
 - where to include metadata-based filtering, done in qiime2 or R?
 - do we need to specify which type of statistical testing we will use for our diversity metrics, and if so, would it be ANOVA (alpha) and PERMANOVA (beta)?
 

## General Questions for the team
- how to refer to these metadata categories? As "personal factors" "characteristics" etc?
- Finalize a title for the proposal
