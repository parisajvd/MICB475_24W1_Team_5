Pre-meeting notes:
  -We decided to commit to the vaping dataset because it would be a novel project and there are a lot of interesting metadata categories to work with.


Meeting Notes
- If doing the automated modelling method:
  - Can get scripts on the modelling from other teams
  - May need to remove NAs or replace with 0s for controls
  - Would use the UK vaping dataset
  - We would be ready to start processing
  - Picrust2: gives us functional information (metabolic pathways) based on the species identified (not necessary but might be interesting if there is little diversity information, so don't add into proposal)
 
Aim 1: Modelling - finding a variable that drives changes in the microbiome divserity
