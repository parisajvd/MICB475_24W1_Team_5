# Meeting 1 Friday Oct 04, 2024

## Pre-meeting notes
We decided to commit to the vaping dataset because it would be a novel project and there are a lot of interesting metadata categories to work with.

## Meeting notes
If doing the automated modelling method:
- Can get scripts on the modelling from other teams
- May need to remove NAs or replace with 0s for controls
- Would use the UK vaping dataset
- We would be ready to start processing
- Picrust2: gives us functional information (metabolic pathways) based on the species identified (not necessary but might be interesting if there is little diversity information, so don't add into proposal)
- Have metadata cleaned before combining into phyloseq
- Always make a duplicate
- Archive metadata in GitHub (as backup)
- Include a folder for R scripts, QIIME2 scripts, etc.
- Send Ritu the qzv file to confirm that we plan to trim the correct amount (also check in for diversity metrics)

## Aims
- Aim 1: Modelling - finding a variable that drives changes in the microbiome divserity (include metadata cleaning)
- Aim 2: Taxonomic analysis on identified variable(s) 
- Aim 3: Diversity metrics
- Aim 4: Taxabar plots (in R)
- Aim 5: Deseq (differential abundance)
- Aim 6: Indicator taxa
