# Notes from this meeting
- We write Shannon diversity in the proposal, but Ritu's modelling code used Bray-Curtis so mauybe we should swap to that to make it easier
- But one of the past student modelling papers used Shannon
- It seems like we need to rarify the phyloseq object before we do the modelling --> do this in R with rarefy_even_depth function and 20034 as the max sampling depth
